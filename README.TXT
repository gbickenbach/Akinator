------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program is comprised of yes/no questions that are asked to the user to try to guess a specific CLN teacher that the user might be thinking of. In essence, the algorithm has four parts: 1) A database of teachers initialized as objects with different boolean characteristics and their given names as well as a question database, 2) A shuffling method for the questions, 3) A series of get algorithms to access each specific trait, and 4) a loop that navigates each question and tests it throughout all teachers. Ultimately, if the guess is incorrect the program will restart in a different order. At the end the program lets the user know the number of attempts.------------------------------------------------------------------------
